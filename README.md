# BombsDontScareMe
SWL Addon which adds a text alert during Seek and Preserve Scenarios to warn of active Explosives and Possessions. 

Display can be dragged during GUIEdit mode and should remember its location.

The message produced when loading the mod (happens once per login or /reloadui) can be silenced with `/setoption bdsm_quiet true`
